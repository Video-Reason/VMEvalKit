VMEvalKit addresses a critical gap in evaluating modern video generation models beyond visual quality metrics. While existing benchmarks focus on photorealism and temporal consistency, VMEvalKit evaluates whether video models can demonstrate genuine reasoning capabilities by solving visual problems through generated video sequences.

### 🔴 Critical Requirement: Text + Image → Video

**VMEvalKit specifically requires models that accept BOTH:**
- 📸 **An input image** (the problem to solve: maze, chess board, etc.)
- 📝 **A text prompt** (instructions: "solve the maze", "show the next move", etc.)

Many models advertise "image-to-video" but only accept images WITHOUT text guidance. These are NOT suitable for reasoning evaluation as they cannot receive problem-solving instructions.
