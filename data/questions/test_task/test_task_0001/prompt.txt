Complete this sliding puzzle. The goal is to arrange the numbered tiles in grid order (filling each row from left to right, with rows from top to bottom), with the empty space at the bottom-right corner.

Rules: Only tiles adjacent to the empty space can be moved. Slide one tile per move into the empty space.

Complete in exactly 1 move.

Do not make extra moves. Keep the camera view fixed and maintain the grid structure unchanged.
