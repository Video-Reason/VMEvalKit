    "maze_task": "Verify that the final frame shows a complete path from start to end that matches the expected solution.",
    "rotation_task": "Check if the final rotation angle and position match the expected result.",
    "raven_task": "Verify that the pattern completion in the final frame matches the expected pattern.",
    "sudoku_task": "Check if the numbers placed in the final frame match the expected solution.",
    "counting_objects_task": "Check if the count shown in the final frame matches the ground_truth_count. Award 1 point if counts match, 0 otherwise.",
    "letter_counting_task": "Check if the count shown in the final frame matches the ground_truth_count for the target letter. Award 1 point if counts match, 0 otherwise.",
    "subway_pathfinding_task": "Check if the agent icon in the final frame is at the correct destination_station. Award 1 point if destination matches, 0 otherwise.",
    "object_subtraction_task": "Verify that the specified object(s) have been correctly removed from the scene, while other objects remain unchanged and the scene remains complete.",
    "majority_color_task": "Verify that all objects in the final frame are recolored to match the most common color in the first frame, while positions and shapes remain unchanged.",
    "grid_shift_task": "Verify that all blocks are shifted 1-2 steps in the instructed direction, without changing their color or relative positions.",
    "object_permanence_task": "Verify that the object(s) remain unchanged in position, color, and shape, and the occluder is moved out of the frame.",

    "dice_2d_task": "Verify that the final frame shows the correct opposite face of the dice. On a standard dice, opposite faces sum to 7 (1↔6, 2↔5, 3↔4). Award 1 point if the shown face matches the expected opposite face, 0 otherwise.",
    "symmetry_completion_task": "Verify that the right half of the grid in the final frame is correctly mirrored from the left half, creating a symmetric pattern. Check that all missing cells have been filled correctly to complete the vertical symmetry.",
    "nonogram_task": "Verify that all cells in the final frame are correctly filled according to the row and column hints. Check that the filled cells match the expected pattern and that all hints are satisfied. Each row and column must have the correct sequence of filled blocks as indicated by the hints."
